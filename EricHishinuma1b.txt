		-What was the experience like when going back to Japan?
		 
Go back to when you were a little kid. Tell us in retrospect, what it was like growing up as an Asian-American?
First off, I’m a yonsei, a 4th generation Japanese American. It means that my great-grandma actually immigrated here and then my grandma on my mom’s side was born in Fresno. So, I would say my household is pretty westernized. And it’s just odd, because, through that, you would have thought there was some mixed marriage or something that would have gone on, but it really has been strictly Japanese. My grandma married Japanese, and my mom married Japanese.

So, growing up in Niles… Niles [Elementary School] is very white, more predominantly white, compared to a lot of the other Fremont schools.

Was that something you noticed very early on?
No, it wasn’t at all. Actually, all throughout elementary school, it was something I just didn’t notice. Pretty much, I just had your ordinary childhood. And then, it wasn’t until probably middle school when sex and sexuality were introduced into the picture.

Like when people started talking about it?
Yeah, it was just more relevant. Because Niles in particular, that elementary school was very much in a bubble. Niles is the more sheltered school compared to a lot of the other elementary schools in Fremont. So when we went to Centerville [Junior High], there was all these different types of people that I’ve never met. There were gangster kids, gothic kids, and all these kids that I’ve never seen before in Niles, because Niles was just one type of people.

What were the people like in Niles?
Just your typical suburban kids. Just good kids. There was no…If there was a mischievous kid, he would not be a genuinely bad-natured person. It’d be more so like, oh, they’re just a troublemaker, but there was not really like a terrible kid in Niles [Elementary School].

That’s so interesting, because that’s completely opposite from my grade. We just had a bunch of degenerates. That’s why some of the Asian people in my class really looked up to some of the Asian people in your class. We were really distant though.

So you said you were really sheltered in Niles.
So it was really at Centerville [Junior High] when sex and sexuality became relevant. That’s when there was a separation between, oh wow, I am different. As an Asian American male, particularly that, I felt like I could see the difference between the ways girls would treat white males or just males that weren’t Asian American. I’m not sure, but that’s just all my subjective experience. I can’t speak for everybody, but for me, that’s the way I saw it. I think at that age, you’re kinda like, girls are something—

They become a source of approval.
Yeah, it starts to becoming relevant at that age. That’s where I started to see the differences. To be honest, I might be selling myself a little short though. 

Were you a part of the conversations? Or did you try to avoid the conversations around sex?
No. Well, I’m not sure. That’s where it gets confusing, because my memory’s kinda clouded. It’s just what I initially feel.

Was it recently that you discovered this?
Maybe recently but not really. Probably during college. My first year, second year. College, when I was still here [in Fremont], was when I started confronting my identity issues and masculinity issues. Instead of hiding away, it’s the elephant in the room, so not trying to avoid the topic but more so looking at it and confronting it. I started getting into reading more authors and more Asian American male authors. [Jimmy], you’ve talked about “Paper Tigers.” There are a lot of articles about male identity issues and more so masculinity in particular.

How did you come to these identity issues though? Was it something presented in a class? Was it through a specific event?
I think it was always rooted throughout high school. I don’t think it was the biggest deal ever though. It wasn’t this thing that loomed over me, like it was everything I thought about. It was just like, oh huh, and then just brush it off.

Did you experience personal rejection?
No, that’s the thing. I think I was really scared all the time, but see that’s the weird part because I think I’m just hypersensitive because just to be completely honest, it sounds like what I’m saying is that, oh I didn’t get attention from girls, but the thing is, I did. So, it’s my own subjective thing. Maybe another person would be telling me, dude, Eric, you’re tripping. Like, what the hell are you talking about? It might have been less about the girls but more about comparing myself to other males. That’s the way I see it though, that’s my truth. I might have been comparing myself to other males that weren’t Asian. 

Because I played in a band, I hung out in the 209’er area a lot, so Modesto, Stockton, all those places where there’s less Asian people. I hung around that a lot, so there was definitely this feeling that my race was relevant in those areas. I was a little more conscious of what I looked like, but it was weird because I had such—for a while and even now—a disconnect with what I look like and who I am inside. It’s really weird actually because I forget I’m Asian and people will just reference, like, what type of Asian food do you like? and I’m like wait what? And then I’m like, ohh okay okay Asian stuff like boba like hahaha. I did that at UCLA a lot because in LA, you would be type-casted immediately. You got to school, you’re Asian, you hang out with the Asian kids. Unless you were some like white-washed Asian dude, you hang out with the white community as the token Asian guy. But if you were like just an Asian person, you would be grouped with the Asian kids, and you would be expected to hang out with the Asian kids. That was a little bit of a surprise.

So you said you hung out in Modesto because you were in a band. So, one of the lyrics to one of the songs—
Oh, god—

“Fucking whore I wanna see your face on the floor”
First off, you can’t preface with that, because I didn’t write those lyrics. That’s the thing. Those were actually written by the previous vocalist. But I performed those lyrics though.

I brought it up ‘cause how did you transition to being in a deathcore band?
I think that the lyrics, if anything, tie to this masculinity kind of thing. But I think that’s how I perceived it at the time. It was just a very trendy thing to write about: misogynistic and very violent lyrics. I wouldn’t co-sign it now. An analogy would be horror movies. You would watch where all this crazy stuff happens and it’s horrible, but at the end, it’s just a movie. The director is not crazy, he’s not actually gonna do all that. It’s entertainment. At the time, it was trending toward that, death metal bands were being very violent. So I think that was more about being young and oh that’s cool that’s in, people like this, so let’s just ride the coat tails and go with the trend. Of course, now, when looking back, it’s kind of silly. 

The band, I Shot the Sheriff, it wasn’t just a hobby but you were actually doing pretty well.
Yeah, it wasn’t just a hobby. We were making money. We were recording at actual studios.

Were you expecting any of that?
No, not at all. It was just for fun really. That was the thing, it was just for fun, just playing music and we just played shows and then people liked it, so we were just like, okay why not keep playing shows and why not start making shirts and…It just became one step after another. Like why not record in a studio now? I might have had goals but it wasn’t make or break, this or bust. It was like, hey we were having fun doing it, we like traveling, we like playing music as a group, so— 

Yeah, it says here that you, the band— 
Where the hell are you taking these…You’re just— 

D-don’t push my sources, Eric. It says it was founded by Eric and James in February of 2006, however in October of 2006 the problems started to arise .
I like how, with Jimmy, I see him at lunch all the time and he never mentions any of this and he goes back into office and he’s probably doing hella research.

Just listen! “The band eventually decides to quit and the members moved on, but then a couple months later, Eric resurrected the band”
Why did it stop and start back up again?
Well, there was two phases of the band with different line-ups. In the first group, we weren’t really friends, we were different parts of other bands conjoined into one band, because we were all stray members. Like, oh, we’re looking for a band to play music. And that was the first band, it consisted of a lot of people that I don’t even talk to anymore. That was the first phase, the first I Shot The Sheriff (ISTS). That disbanded, and I don’t know how long it did, but maybe a little less than a year.

You were in the original group?
Yeah, I was in the original group. I started it. James is was the songwriter, and I did some of the songwriting but I took up more of a manager [role].

How did you meet James?
Just playing music with my friends. I used to play with Aaron, and Aaron used to play with James. Then one day, he just started playing together with us. And then James and I, we really liked technical guitar riffs and metal music. Aaron and my other friend, Wesley, didn’t play metal aggressive music. They played more traditional rock music. But James and I, as guitar players, we were really gravitating more toward the fast-paced music. That’s what metal music offered for us, so we went that route. 

How did you pick up the guitar?
It started with my cousins, Kelsey, Kory, who are older than me, and they played guitar and I thought it was really cool. And I always liked rock music, and one summer I saw them play. They had a performance at my family reunion and then that summer when we drove back down from Portland, I told my dad, hey I wanna play guitar. My dad was like, really you sure? And I was like, yeah yeah yeah I really want to, I thought it was really cool. And then yeah, just within a week of when we got back, my dad got a guitar from his friend. He was like, here, take it.

Did you practice everyday?
It wasn’t like, ah I gotta practice. It was more so like, this is so fun and it didn’t feel like working. It just felt like, oh man, this song, I love this song, I wanna play this song. It felt very natural. It didn’t feel like, I gotta get good, here’s a goal, I want to get to this goal. It didn’t feel like that. It felt like that every step of the way was a mini-success, like oh yeah I got this part of the song down. So yeah, it was pretty natural. Me and music and guitar was a natural thing.

You said that your dad got you the guitar. Did he realize the type of music you were gonna play? Did your family ever hear the type of music that you played?
Yeah, we had band practice at my house.

What did they think about, these lyrics?
My parents, I don’t know if they heard the lyrics. ‘Cause when you’re screaming, you can’t really decipher what you’re actually saying. So to them, it just sounds like screaming. It doesn’t really matter what you’re screaming. 

Do you remember if your mom had anything to say?
No, not really. Well it was really loud in my house, but nothing specifically about the lyrics. But in terms of the noise level, sometimes we had to turn it down a notch. Or the neighbors, we got called on by the cops, and they came a couple times, so that happened. It was just your typical band. 

So then you started touring. Were you spending more time on that compared to school?
Yeah it totally conflicted with school. I just did not like school. I don’t even remember school. I don’t remember studying or doing homework or taking tests. I barely remember that because I never do it. And I got a truancy notice that I was skipping class all the time.

Which year in high school did you travel for music?
It was sophomore year. 

How long was this?
It was just an eight-day trip, maybe nine-day trip, something like that. It was only in California, but we went all the way up to Sacramento and northern areas and then we went all the way down to LA. We stopped along the way, like at Bakersfield, Fresno, Modesto.

Was it always a sold out show?
Some were bigger than others. They weren’t all hits, some of them didn’t have anybody or barely anybody. I would say that a good portion of those shows had some people there. So, it was fun. Definitely very unorthodox in terms of something you do when you’re 16. Whenever I tell that story to people, I’m like, yeah we bought some fuckin’ van for $500 and we were driving at three in the morning, and the dude’s that’s driving is 17 or 18 years old, and we’re 16. It’d just be like, damn, it feels like a blur, because we crashed at people’s houses that we didn’t even know. There was this woman in Bakersfield who was like, hey bands, come to my house, we have an open house. She went by, I think, Coco, or something like that. Some fuckin’ weird name. We’d be like, okay cool, free house to stay at. We had money in our box but we weren’t gonna book a place and stay the night. We literally went with no plan and were like, we’ll just figure it out when we’re there.
 
You guys didn’t have a manager?
We didn’t. If anything, I was doing that role. I was young so I didn’t know how everything went.
 
And you said you don’t talk to the band mates anymore. Did you guys split on bad terms or good terms?
You mean, go through each individual band member? There’s an interesting story for each one.
 
I bring this up because I notice that when people approach you to talk about ISTS, they come from a very passionate place. It’s always like, you were in ISTS. But then you are like—
I thought this was about Asian masculinity.
 
It’s only been 30 minutes.
It’s like, Eric and then ISTS.
 
It’s going to get there. You kinda just brush it off. Why do you feel not as passionate about what you did compared to how other people do?
Oh just like the band in general?
 
People really liked your music.
Yeah, so why did I feel…?
 
It almost seems that you want to push it away. Is that true?
There was a time when I actually requested interviews to take down my name, like on Google search. I was very ashamed and felt like, I gotta take this shit down. I personally messaged every single website that had our stuff up or had my full name. If you notice in the bios, it says “Eric” and the last name’s gone. It’s because I personally requested to take my last name down.
 
How long ago was it?
Probably five or six years ago. Because the lyrics were a little bit much and I wanted to get on with my life. I don’t want this to be like, Eric Hishinuma wrote this. There was just a natural maturity. I’m onto the next phase of my life. It’s like baggage. It’s a very polarizing experience. I am very proud of it and I’ll tell people, but when people want to know more. I’ll say, yeah I played in a band. And they’ll be like, so what was your band name? And I’ll be like, uh, you don’t need to know about it, it’s all good.
A big part of it has to do with the lyrics. If the lyrics weren’t bad, I think I’d be more okay with it. It’s a combination of the lyrics and how aggressive the music is. It’s just screaming in your face. People now that I associate with aren’t necessarily into that music. So to be like, oh here listen to my old band, I don’t think that’s what they would expect. It’s not like they’d be like, oh yeah hell yeah let me download some into my iTunes. So it’s like, why even suggest it if there’s no point because they’re not going to listen to it anyway.
 
Yeah, so you’re really different now from what the music is portraying. You’re a lot more calm and less aggressive.
Nicole: It colored a part of your background but it doesn’t mean that it defines you.
Yeah, there’s a disconnect between how I identified myself back then and how I can’t even associate with some of the things that I did back then with right now. I think a lot of people are like that. People cringe at things that they did during junior high or high school. That’s just another one of those things. You’re just kinda like, oh, you know.
 
So you don’t listen to deathcore music anymore.
Not really. I’ll listen to an occasional song every now and then, but not really honestly. But I still like the music. I just don’t really listen to it.
 
What if it said nice things while screaming at you?
Well there is that. There’s Christian metal bands. They’re screaming about God, praising God, and they’re screaming.

How was it moving from doing that? You stopped the band and you moved on. And now you’re doing something completely different. And the context is completely different. How did you get there? Specifically, how was it applying to college? How did you feel during that phase? You said that you missed some of school and that it was like a blur.
It was the tail end of high school, the end of junior year. It was when it became relevant, college and applying and all that stuff, during that third year. I think from what I remember throughout that whole process, I was like, oh I’m not doing that well. I’m just gonna be here. Am I gonna be in Fremont this whole time? It was those questions during junior year. So that’s when it became a reality check that there was a life after high school. My focus shifted a little bit. It was my senior year of high school when I made the jump. But it was too late by then.
 
Why did you make the jump?
The whole thing of realizing that people are leaving. Realizing that I wasn’t able to go anywhere. Just that realization of, damn is it too late? Now, you can always go to some junior college. You can salvage, you can start over. And I was like wait, they don’t look at your high school transcripts at all in junior college? And they’re like, no not at all. And I was like, oh shit, okay, if that’s the case I’m in on this, I’m gonna do this thing. So, that it. I did well in senior year of high school. I focused and got my study habits right. It was an easier transition when I actually went to DeAnza [College] that first quarter. I really just disappeared from all my friends for that year, 2009 until 2010. I kinda fell off the map. It’s like I missed a whole phase of my friends’ chapter, because no one saw me. Because I literally went home and studied and went to class, because I wanted good grades and wanted to get out that year. But when I started to get more comfortable with my routine, I went back out and was like, oh what’s up. But I think that year, nothing else mattered.
 
Were you just not responding?
I don’t really remember honestly. School was a while ago. But my mindset was that if I’m into something, I’m all into it. I’m very focused once I commit myself. If I really want to get out, my goal was to experience what it would be like to be somewhere else. That was my goal. So that year, I really buckled down.
 
Did your family play a big part in that? Was it all through yourself? Did your parents urge you to do certain things?
No, they didn’t urge it. It came from within me. It really did. It came from myself and my own motivation. Of course, my family’s really supportive and really happy, actually, when things changed.
 
Were they disappointed before?
Yeah, they were definitely disappointed. I really put my parents through a hard time in high school. I got suspended, I did a lot of bad stuff. There’s something about it that ties back to this Asian thing. There’s something disturbing about how I think about this. There’s something about being a bad kid that I thought was cool at the time. I was this Asian kid, and Asian American males are like…I thought it was strangely empowering.
 
You’re not following the model minority.
Yeah, exactly, it’s about that Asian kid that does well in school. It’s like, no, I’m not that, so I am this: I play in a death metal band, I don’t get good grades, I smoke weed. And there was something that I felt was cool about that. When you look back on it, it looks dumb. But at the time, that was my way of justifying everything.
 
Some of your band mates are Asian, too.
Yeah, that’s true. I can’t say that they have the same views as me. I can only speak for myself. They were Asian. That’s just the way it happened. There was no, hey we’re Asian let’s do this. We just happened to get along with each other. Some were Asian, some weren’t Asian. I think there was also a draw to our band specifically, because we were Asian and we looked like little kids and we wore polo shirts. I didn’t dress all metal and black shirts. I wore polo shirts and Hollister clothes, and I would go on stage and start fuckin’ screaming. And all my friends in the band that were Asian, Hobbes and James, were Asian kids and they’d be dressed hella casually like a skater kid and then you’d just start playing intense music. There’s something that stood out to people. People would always shrug us off, people who didn’t know us, especially when we started touring. All these metal kids would be playing with long hair, and then all of a sudden we would go up on stage and they’d be like, whoa, they’re Asian. There was something really cool about proving people wrong. I really enjoyed that. By playing that role, the Asian kid, when I’m on stage and then the lights go dim and then the music starts playing and you just go all out. There’s just something that felt satisfying. Doing that and people being little surprised because we didn’t look the part.
 
So going back to your parents being a little disappointed. You said you studied at DeAnza. Usually junior college is more for general requirements. At that point, were you thinking about what was the next step? Did you have a plan? What were you gonna do after DeAnza? Where were you gonna go?
Well I wanted to be a film major, because I really like making movies.
 
When did that start?
It started senior year of high school when I picked up a camera. Well, actually I’ve been into filming since I was a kid. It was something I did with my cousins. I was eight years old, but I had a hiatus when I picked up the guitar and the whole band thing. But after that got settled, I picked up the camera again and I wanted to start filming. Then it turned into a hobby that I enjoyed. For the longest time, I wanted to do film, be a film major, and be in that whole industry. That was the goal for a while in college.

How long was that?
I was at DeAnza for three years. Pretty much at DeAnza, until the beginning of last year when I started being like, ehh, I don’t know if I like making movies that much.
 
That’s interesting, because that was when you were applying to transfer to a university.
That’s why the thing that I applied to was a very spontaneous thing. I applied twice. After two years at DeAnza, I applied to schools. I got into all the UC’s that I applied to, but I didn’t get into San Diego State.
 
Which programs did you apply to?
I honestly forgot.
 
Was it film?
I think it might’ve been film. The first time I applied was for film stuff. During the first round, I actually got into Berkeley and then I fucked up on a class. So they had to rescind my acceptance. It was an econ class or something; it was something really dumb. There’s a whole other story because there was extracurricular stuff happening during that time, which made it hard to focus on my work. So that diverted my attention outside of my school. [Being rescinded] was a huge wake up call. I was all ready to go. My mom was like, just go somewhere else, you have to go this year. And I was just gonna take a chance, wait another year, and just reapply.
 
Was she mad?
Yeah, I remember she was crying and so upset with me. I was like, no, I’m just gonna reapply next year, it’s good.
 
What about your dad?
I don’t remember my dad too much. I just remember my mom. My mom felt very strongly about me leaving. I was like, don’t worry I’ll get in again. So it was a risk for sure.
 
Nicole: So you were at home at this time, so it’s a very present parent there.
It was a risk for sure. It was crazy that I did that but it all worked out.
 
Nicole: So what did you do during that year then?
That was a really dark year for me. My mindset was very dark. I only went out to do stuff at night. My friend and I would just go out, and we would smoke every night that year. I was in a very dark place.
 
Would you say you were depressed?
Just depressed, a little bit. First off, there was the whole school thing. I didn’t have time to get a job because I was gonna leave soon. It was this awkward time, because the employers were like, are you gonna be here for a year? And I’m like, no, I’m gonna leave soon. And they’d be like sorry, we like you but sorry. There was that whole issue. There was also the issue that I had finished my classes. I didn’t have a lot of classes to take. I just took a drawing class for fun, and that was a night class. So other than that, I was just chillin’.

Was this your third year?
Yeah, I was just winging it. I had just gone through my first girlfriend thing. That was my first experience ever and that had ended in a really bad way. That low-key traumatized me in some ways. I was very scarred from that whole experience, and Brandon was there for me. Because everyone else left. All of my friends were in college. Brandon and I would go out and smoke at the same spot every night and we’d go eat something at In-N-Out. Then we’d go home and I would sleep and wake up in the afternoon. And I’d do the same thing over again. I was just in a really bad place. I felt really bad about myself. I was going through these personal self-image issues, too, because she broke up with me. She did this because I’m not a good-looking person. And, I’m ugly. I would go through that whole thing, and I was so trapped in that cycle of perceiving myself as an unattractive person. And I was like, no one is ever gonna like me. Smoking didn’t help either. I would smoke all the time, and I would go out at night only. I wasn’t doing anything. That whole period was very dark and not fun. I almost regret doing that because when I got to UCLA the first year, I was in a funky mindset. It carried over. I  forgot what it was like to meet people, socialize, because I was trapped in that weird phase.

You said that the third year was also the year that you deviated from film, right?
Oh, my third year of junior college. 

Before you went to UCLA, what kind of colleges were you gonna applying to? You had wanted to do film and you took that little gap year. It’s so risky. What were you thinking about?
I didn’t apply to many schools that next round, like three schools. I think applied as a psychology major for some schools. 

Why did you pick psychology?
I was drawn to psychology. The psychology course I took in college at DeAnza was really interesting. I was trying to get out honestly. I didn’t have a clear path. It was like, I like this, let me just do this because it’s something that I like. I didn’t put a whole lot of thought, as much thought as I should have probably back then. I applied as a Design Media & Arts major for UCLA, and that was the one that I wanted to get into. It had a very, very low acceptance rate, so it was a risk now that I think about it. I was all in for that school. 

And you applied for film for Berkeley, right?
It was something film or media-based.

You got into UCLA. Was your mom finally happy that you did that?
Definitely. I wanted to go to UCLA. I had wanted to go to Berkeley but at the same time I wanted to leave. I was trying to go to LA because I wanted to experience what it was like living somewhere else, being far away from home. So, LA was always my first choice ever since I started DeAnza. I remember going to my counselor and he was like, let’s sit down and let’s map out your courses so you can have an idea of which schools you want to transfer to. He was trying to pick out Bay Area schools. He said oh yeah how about SF State, San Jose State. I was like, actually I’m trying to go to UCLA honestly. He said, oh okay well let me take this shit out. I immediately, that first, initially when I went to DeAnza, I knew I wanted to go to UCLA for economics. 

What was that like? What was so attractive?
It was a UC. My family can’t afford private schools. It was almost strictly UC schools or Cal state schools. I wanted to go to LA, so it made sense to go to UCLA. It would satisfy both. At the time I wanted to do film, I had the time, and I just stuck to it. There was a design program and it was more up my alley when I saw the work. That was a little bit more of what I want to do. I don’t really like the screenwriting process or character development. Film is more theory, and I kinda like doing the things. I don’t really like long movies. I have a short attention span so I can’t sit through movies. I like more 5-minute videos, music videos, something really short and concise like a really good advertisement. That’s more up my alley. That’s why I gravitated more toward that program. 

You said you really liked LA. I’m assuming you’d been there before?
Definitely. Just had an uncle that lived there in Chino Hills. Just your standard Disneyland trips with family. Family vacations in LA, it’s just so close. 

When you got to UCLA, was it what you’d expected? The design program, being in LA, and going to UCLA?
My first year, no, it wasn’t. It was really hard my first year actually. Because first off, it was the mindset I was in, it wasn’t really good. I had a lot of confidence issues as well. My self-image issues, again, that first year. Just a lot of not healthy mindset. not really in the right mindset to meet people because you have to go through it by yourself. Be confident in order to feel comfortable meeting people. I don’t think I was in that state of mind at the time. That in combination with. .. I think that primarily the root of the issue, not feeling great about myself that first year. It kind of led to…I think when you are in that mindset, you’re not necesaily someone that people want to be around. You’re not too willing to put yourself out there. 

Like a bad aura?
Yeah you’re not being mean and people can’t quite put their finger on it. Like lack of eye contact, nervousness, [] uncomfortable, feel awkward. It could be that. And I’m naturally an awkward person and shy as well. I’m very conscious of how I’m being perceived to other people which is why initially I was with this recording, I was like whoa this is freaking me out because I was super congizanet of everything around me, who’s listening to me, where’s this going. Now it’s okay because I forgot about it. Initially, i was hyperaware.

Yeah, I’m not even recording. 
Oh really. 
I’m just a very self-conscious person in general, I think. I could go into more details about that first year but to sum it up basically it wasn’t the smoothest year. I remember calling my parents a lot that year. I would just talk to a few people back home a lot. 

Did you talk about your parents about what you were going through?
Yeah, I’m open with my parents. I kinda frustrated my dad a lot because I would lay the burden on him a lot. I was like, I don’t have a whole lot of friends here honestly. It was hard, I feel like everyone is not like me, i feel out of place. JUst a lot of putting myself out there, those things not working out and trying something else. 

Did yuo talk to your parents about what happened with your preous gf?
No, didn’t go into too much details. I touched on it, but I don’t think they knew the extent of the effect on me. They knew about her because they met her, she was over a handful of times. Yeah they knew who she was. ever since that happened, that was 2011 2012, they mentioned her acknowledged her for a little but after, maybe once or twice, but ever since, never have talked about her. literally like she never existed. 

And you said when you told your dad, you laid it all on your dad? what kind of advice did he give you?
About my college experience? Just kinda not really…i don’t really remember, i just know that moreso having him as an ear to listen to me, support me. I’m a person that when i’m struggling thtough something, i externalize it, not internalize it. which is not always a good thing, when i have something, i tend to vocalize it a lot. when something hurts me or when im struggling to do something. i like to talk about it, the problems, which can be good because then it feels good and you’re not stressing out about it. but then for whoever you’re talking to, you might be doing it too much, it can stress them out too, so you’re burden on them. there’s two sides of the coin for that stuff. 

more on my middle sister. ever since she went to college, growing up they were always, oh eric! and his two little sisters and doing their thing. then lauren really opened a lot when she got to college. she was really shy in hgih school, didn’t really feel like she was what she felt she was inside. once she got to college, she met her core group of friends. now i felt like i connect with her a lot more on that level so i felt more comfortable with her. ever since her college, i feel very open with her, talking about her. kristen of course i’m going to talk with her, but not so much. she’s very supportive.

how old is kristen?
i think 20. she’s at ohlone right now. she’s gonna hear where’s she going this friday. she’s out, she’s going out this fall. so, kristen is still, i would say she’s old enough to understand, in terms of experience, she’s always gonna be supportive and always giving encouragement all the time. just in terms of experience, it’s honestly younger. i’m like four five years older. lauren is two years younger. 

how old are you?
i’m 24.

oh okay, lauren is 23. so there’s not much of an age gap. 

what’re your two sister studying?
lauren is working now. she’s an engineer, mechanical engineer. 

oh where at?
she majored in mechanical engineer but she’s an applications engineer, like with solidworks. she’s a person, she works at a place called [] in Santa Clara right now. she’s doing her things there. she’s moved back at home, too. so we’re both at home and working full-time. and kristen is doing her thing.

do you know what she’s trying to major in?
kristen, i haven’t talked to her too mch about it honestly. 

i have a friend who’s also a mechanical engineer[tangent]

let’s go back to, you talked about how you were in a funky place. you arrived at LA and then you..how did you get out of that and proceed towards DESMA and all the projects that you did?
this is gonna sound crazy but i didn’t get out of that funk until 2014 honestly, fully. it was like i felt better and slowly got to meet more people, more friends, like okay, i have people to hang out with. it started feeling better, so that 2014 year obviously was a transition. i wouldn’t say until summer 2014 was when i really hit my stride a little bit. i think summer 2015 was actually 180. summer 2015, this past summer, to when i first took UCLA, was like night and day. was totally flipped. it was weird, a full transformation, it’s in my head, my mental state, from bad to a really good state. i kinda didn’t answer your question though. how did i do it…

How’d you get out of the funk? 
Well, it was like a progression really. It wasn’t like *snap* I’m good now, you know. It was doing this and meeting people. And then just slowly feeling better.

So I want to talk a little bit about probably the best project you’ve ever done. The project you did on Asian-American masculinity.
Oh okay.

Nicole: Wait tell me about it, because I don’t know about it.

Ah, it’s so weird to talk about because it’s so long ago. Well, it’s not that long ago, but I just need a refresh. 

Yeah, think about this way.  What was the context for the project?

Well, okay, I was at a healthy place doing the project.

What year was this? 
2015 in February. So a little over 2015.

You were part of desma [Design Media Arts, at University of California Los Angeles]?
Yeah.

I felt comfortable in a place because I wasn’t actively experiencing those feelings at the time. So it was more of a reflection. I was totally not feeling these feelings. So I was okay with opening up and sharing. Because right now, I’m not even in that state of mind, you know? So that’s kind of where it all started. It was also my last project, so I wanted to do something personal.

Go all out.
Yeah, to do something to really hit the core of who I was, not bullshit. 

Hm, so what were the projects usually about then? How did they assign it to you?
It was pretty open-ended and they gave you a lot of freedom. It’s more of just do what you want. Usually the structure of the curriculum is that in the beginning you take a lot of pre-reqs to learn the software or programs. Just introduce you to what you’re doing. Then as you go into program towards the very end, they’re like do what you want, but apply all the stuff you learned. It’s just very open-ended. Just do what you want.

You mentioned this before about why you picked this project. Can you reiterate on--
Yeah, so I’ll just sum it up basically. I think actually watching it cause it’s a video, but it’s actually filmed on Super 8 millimeter.

What’s a Super 8 mm?
It’s like a film camera. Old film camera.

But actually, I think watching isn’t necessary. I think I can explain my idea, and you would kind of understand it as well. Basically, it’s like tying the whole asian masculinity and kind of what I touched on earlier on how my experience as an Asian-American male ties into how my grandma was in the Japanese internment camps in the 1940’s. I feel like I was very careful with not wanting to…how do i say this…I didn’t want to magnify my personal issues and make the connection that my problems were bigger than those problems. Because those problems are massive and an actual problem and mine is just so first-world. Like “dude, shut the fuck up” (laughs)

So, I think that was a huge concern, but the real good thing about it though. I totally forgot about this. But my professor knew a person who was in the Japanese internment camp. Who actually watched my presentation—

Whoa.
And she actually said, thank you for doing this.

Nicole: Aww.

And that was the final praise. Like at least I didn’t disrespect. Like the last thing I wanted to do was disrespect any of the people. So it was just really nice that she gave me approval: “What you did was really good and I’m glad you did this”.  I totally forgot about that whole thing

I didn’t even talk about the project though. (Nicole laughs) Basically, it’s tying the whole experience growing up and making that connection with the confinements of the internment camps and the discrimination they felt. And how it manifests, yeah sure the discrimination isn’t as blatant, or forward. It’s more subc-subtle. Its nuanced. It’s not like “Hey, you Jap”, its more about what you’re not doing. So, its how those are present in both eras.

So what was the video?
The video is a very long clip, 5 minutes of an Asian-American male sitting on the group in the desert with this Japanese bondage technique called Kinbaku. It’s a rope bondage technique. It’s basically restrained.  It’s kind of just sitting in the desert. having the camera recording it as the wind kind of goes. The significance of the location is that I went to Manzanar, which is one of the locations of the Japanese internment camps. It’s near Owen’s lake. And I didn’t really specify where it was. It was just a subliminal. You can kind of recognize the mountains and the little telephone poles/wires. The telephone poles are really distinct. The whole idea of that being the background, but also that being in the background. Not like hey this is Manzanar. 

If you look hard enough--
you’ll understand. There’s a lot that i put into that image I put in that is very rich.

Was there dialogue?
No, I debated that. No, I totally forgot, but it’s the God Bless America song is playing in the background, but it’s the 1940s version.

How long was the clip?
It was like 5 minutes. As long as the Super 8 mm goes and the song. It was display on really large screen, so it almost felt life-sizes. The Asian-American male had their shirt off and tied in a bondage technique, almost like feminizing him in that  way. Kind of also feel like restrained. Just tying all these ideas into one single image while the song plays.

Nicole: Yeah usually you see those bondage techniques on women.
Yeah exactly, it’s more women based.  That parallels with the Asian-American masculinity. I’m not sure how I feel now. It’s harder for me to see now, but I needed to prove myself as a man. That ties into the metal band. I wanted to scream as loud as I could because I could be more manly if i do that. I mean that wasn’t sole reason I wanted to be in a band. That was an aspect to it. That was just one side of the many sides. There was that whole issue. Pretty much…that was the project. There was a lot more to it….

Was the book part of it?
Yeah this is the book. It’s actually not presented the right way.. I had a piece of rope tied around and put in a box with dirt from Manzanar. And then, I placed it on a stand by the film. This is more of an accompaniment. Because when people watch it“What is this?” This is more of a thing that gives a little bit more context.

Did you bind it yourself?
Yeah i binded it myself. 

So how does this book supplement the movie?
Basically just the ideas. I also presented in a way where I didn’t write everything out. It’s more so you make the connection yourself. You gotta work hard at it. The person reading it has to work a littl bit to understand.

I like this picture because it sets up what this is about. Kind of them trapped and confined and then looking at me who’s like confined in my own way. It kind of just sets the book up. 
I have these huge gauges. At the time, I felt like it was a tough thing.
I think this is one of my favorite pages. 

So its like a really personal project.

Yeah it’s like the more personal project ever. I personally wouldn’t do something like this again.
[about the book] just a lot of quotes i felt were relevant. The pages are juxtaposed so that they make sense. They’re almost like companion pages.

When you worked on all these different type of projects, not this included. Did you show all your friends or family?
Oh I showed my family, but it was little bit too personal to explain exactly what I did.

How did you show your family?
I didn’t get too much detail. It was actually received pretty well with my professor. So I felt really proud, but at the same time it was really personal. So there was this line I didn’t wanna cross.

But I felt it like it was a good opportunity to do this thing. I probably wouldn’t do something like this again. I felt like this was something I always wanted to do, so now I had a reason to do it.

Comparing when you started this project till now, is there any difference in how you think about things?
To be honest, no. I was already in a state mind where this was all in the past. I was already removed from it, didn’t really change anything. Just put it out there. I was already in a certain place. Does that make sense?

Also another parallel, they took possessions from the families and then Japanese males of their households and were stripped of their masculinity because they were stripped of their belongings. I think I have a quote that talks about how it was castration or a stripped from the castrated scissors. 

So the parallel wasn’t a thing I conjured up in my head, it’s very much talked about the stripping of the masculinity Japanese American males in these internment camps. So it is a thing.

You said you presented in a really wide screen with a pedestal and a box. And people were able to interact with the book. Was this format of the project….was everyone doing something similar?
No, everyone did their own thing. It was a really open-ended project. There were things you could do: interactivity (coding), visual communication (which is what i did), and gaming. There was a video class, but I wasn’t actually in that class. I took the visual communication class because I loved the professor that did it. I always prioritized my professor. No one knew who the video professor was. So there was a video class. 

Interesting.

Whats your perspective now?
Well, I’m in a very healthy mindset. I think i know who i am. At the time, I was struggling to find out who you are. I actually completely say I know who I am. I think its a process. You never know. But I’m getting there and making progress. Slowly making my way. You cannot skips steps to get to where you are. Still going through problems, there just different problems.
